## Overview
"Canon Defense" is an engaging artillery-based game where players take control of a powerful cannon.
The game falls within the tower defense genre and centers around a military theme, providing players with an engaging experience of defending against incoming waves of enemies.

## Objective

The objective is to defend against incoming military enemies that appear, ranging from infantry, fast-moving vehicles and heavily armored vehicles.

## Mechanics

**Reload**

In "Canon Defense," the cannon employs two distinct reloading mechanics to enhance gameplay dynamics:

- **Reload Between Shots:**

    After each shot, the cannon undergoes a quick 2-second reloading process. This allows players to maintain a continuous rate of fire during active engagements. The short reload time encourages a fast-paced and action-packed experience, enabling players to respond swiftly to incoming enemies.

- **Reload When Ammo Reaches 0:**

    The cannon has a finite magazine capacity of 10 shots. Once players expend all 10 rounds, the cannon enters a brief cooldown period.

    During this downtime, lasting 10 seconds, the cannon is inactive as it undergoes a complete reload, replenishing its entire ammunition supply. This mechanic introduces a strategic pause in the gameplay, prompting players to plan their shots and manage resources judiciously.

   - *Description:* Incorporate an electromagnetic pulse (EMP) burst generator into the cannon, temporarily disabling electronic systems of enemy vehicles.
   - *Effect:* Briefly immobilizes enemy vehicles upon impact 5 seconds.

**Rewards**

These dual reloading mechanics offer a dynamic and strategic element to the gameplay in "Canon Defense". Players must balance the rapid reload between shots for continuous engagement with the tactical decision of when to reload the entire magazine to ensure sustained defense against waves of incoming enemies.

Players earn points for each successfully destroyed enemy using the cannon.
Accumulated points serve as currency for purchasing upgrades to enhance the cannon's capabilities.
This strategic element allows users to tailor their cannon to their preferred playstyle and optimize its effectiveness against different enemy types.
